# _ChRIS_ users

## Abstract

This RFC proposes a user and group model for _ChRIS_.

## Introduction

As alluded to in `14-ChRISpermissions.adoc` _ChRIS_ needs a more formally defined user concept. It is argued that a better permission model (including more formalized users concept) can lead to considerable simplifications in conceptualizing the multi-user nature of _ChRIS_.

## What exists

_ChRIS_ currently supports two classes of users -- a "normal" user and an elevated pseudo "root" user. The permissions and roles of these users is not strictly defined and has been implemented largely ad-hoc.

## Proposed

The concept of _users_ is closely allied to the implementation of a file/directory permission model. By defining access, usage, and visibility criteria for files and associating these with a _user_ or a list of users, we allow _ChRIS_ to be more secure going forward, provide more sane sharing features, and act more consistently with established and existing practices.

### Users and ``uid``

Each user in _ChRIS_ shall have a corresponding `uid` (user-id) that uniquely identifies the user. This `uid` can be associated with a string user name.

* The `root` user shall have a `uid` of 0.
* A default user called `all` exists and every user of the system can by default "see" the objects owned by `all`.

### "Groups" are just users, too!

To allow for better sharing, we propose handling the idea of user "groups". In a slight departure from conventional UNIX norms, we propose that "groups" are simply "users" from a functional perspective -- in other words the system only knows "users". A client (human or software) user of the system, however, can be one of many "users", depending on role or context.

* any user can "become" any group by simply knowing the group name and password
* file/directory object ownership is simply a list of "users", thus a generalization of the standard UNIX 3-tuple to an _N_-tuple.

The deeper practical implications of this concept would need to be more fully explored.
