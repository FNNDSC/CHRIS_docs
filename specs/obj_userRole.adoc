# _ChRIS_ users

## Abstract

This RFC proposes an object user and permission model for _ChRIS_.

## Introduction

_ChRIS_ consists of _users_ and _objects_. While the idea of _users_ is generally easily understood, the concept of an _object_ is a superset of all named elements that can be expressed in a _ChRIS_ filesystem. While this obviously means _directories_ and _files_, the concept of a _file_ in the _ChRIS_ filesystem can also be _virtual_ database element (such as a _plugin_, or a representation of some internal _ChRIS_ state such as a _computeEnvironment_).

## Summary

The _ChRIS_ filesystem will be used to expose not only real actual files that exist in the _ChRIS_ system and which are in object storage, but also support _links_ (implemented in the _ChRIS_ database) to real files. In addition, the _ChRIS_ filesystem will use a file metaphor to express non-file objects, such as _plugins_, and internal system values.

### Users and ``uid``

Each user in _ChRIS_ shall have a corresponding `uid` (user-id) that uniquely identifies the user. This `uid` can be associated with a string user name.

* The `root` user shall have a `uid` of 0;
* A human/client of _ChRIS_ shall have a primary _username_ but can also be a _member_ of many other named _users_;
* The CUBE database shall maintain this association;
* A default user called `all` exists and every user of the system is part of `all`.
* 

### "Groups" are just users, too!

To allow for better sharing, we propose handling the idea of user "groups". In a slight departure from conventional UNIX norms, we propose that "groups" are simply "users" from a functional perspective -- in other words the system only knows "users". A client (human or software) user of the system, however, can be one of many "users", depending on role or context.

* any user can "become" any group by simply knowing the group name and password
* file/directory object ownership is simply a list of "users", thus a generalization of the standard UNIX 3-tuple to an _N_-tuple.

The deeper practical implications of this concept would need to be more fully explored.
