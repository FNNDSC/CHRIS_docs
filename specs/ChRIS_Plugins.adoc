THIS DOCUMENT WAS WRITTEN RETROSPECTIVELY.

It is a retrospective interpretation of what can be assumed to be the expected
behavior of the "current" ChRIS components.

Niche behavior which needs explanation are explained by a permalink to
the block of code which implemented the behavior, preceeded by the string "// retrospection ".

== About this Specification

This document, the _ChRIS Plugin Specification_ or sometimes referred to as
the _spec_, provides the technical definition of a _ChRIS plugin_ within
the context of _ChRIS_ components such as the
https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_store[ChRIS Store],
https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backEnd[ChRIS backend],
https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ui[ChRIS user interface],
and https://github.com/FNNDSC/pman[pman].

This file originates from the Github repository https://github.com/FNNDSC/CHRIS_docs[FNNDSC/CHRIS_docs] by the filename https://github.com/FNNDSC/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/SPEC.adoc[SPEC.adoc]. Please check online for the latest version.

=== State of the Specification

This document was first drafted on 2022-01-26.

== Introduction

_ChRIS_ is an open-source web platform for computational workflows in scientific and medical applications. For more information on _ChRIS_, see https://chrisproject.org/ and https://github.com/FNNDSC/CHRIS_docs

[#definition]
== Definition of a _ChRIS_ Plugin

A _ChRIS_ plugin is an association between
a <<name,Name>>, <<public_repo,URL>>, <<dock_image,Image>>, and a <<descriptor_file,JSON representation>>.

[#name]
=== _ChRIS_ Plugin Name

The _name_ of a _ChRIS_ plugin is a string.
Its purpose is to be a human-friendly identifier for
its associated <<pluginmeta,_ChRIS_ plugin meta>>.

[#public_repo]
=== URL

The _url_ of a _ChRIS_ plugin is an HTTPS
https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt[URL]
denoting where the source code for the _ChRIS_ plugin can be found.

[#dock_image]
=== Image

The _image_ of a _ChRIS_ plugin is the name of an
https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md[OCI image manifest tag].

[#descriptor_file]
=== JSON Representation

A _ChRIS plugin_'s JSON representation describes its <<usage,usage>> as a JSON file
with the following schema:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "name": "string",
  "dock_image": "string",
  "public_repo": "string",

  "type": "fs" | "ds" | "ts",
  "parameters": ParameterSpec[],
  "icon": "string",
  "authors": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "category": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "documentation": "string",
  "license": "string",
  "version": "string",
  "selfpath": "string",
  "selfexec": "string",
  "execshell": "string",
  "max_number_of_workers": int,
  "min_number_of_workers": int,
  "max_memory_limit": int,
  "min_memory_limit": int,
  "max_cpu_limit": int,
  "min_cpu_limit": int,
  "max_gpu_limit": int,
  "min_gpu_limit": int
}
----

The keys `name`, `dock_image`, and `public_repo` are required when uploading a plugin to _CUBE_.
They must be left out when uploading a plugin to a _ChRIS Store_.

[#plugin-type]
==== Plugin Type

Plugin type is one of:

- fs
- ds
- ts

These represent, respectively: _feed synthesis_, _data synthesis_, _topology synthesis_.

[#plugin-parameters]
==== Parameters

_Plugin parameters_ encode for <<arguments,arguments>>.

The value for `"parameters"` should be a list of objects following the `PluginParameter` schema:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "name": "string",
  "type": "bool" | "int" | "float" | "str" | "path" | "unextpath",
  "optional": boolean,
  "flag": "string",
  "short_flag": "string",
  "action": "store" | "store_true" | "store_false",
  "help": "string",
  "default": any | null,
  "ui_exposed": boolean
},
----

===== Parameter Name

===== Parameter Type

A parameter type is one of:

====== bool

One of: `true`, `false`

====== int

Integers as described by
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159.html#section-6[RFC 7159 Section 6].

====== float

Numbers as described by
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159.html#section-6[RFC 7159 Section 6].

[#param-type-str]
====== str

Strings as described by
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159.html#section-7[RFC 7159 Secion 7].

[#param-type-path]
====== path

A <<param-type-str,str>> which is interpreted as a comma-separated
list of path names into _ChRIS_ file storage.
See section <<path-arguments>>.

[#param-type-unextpath]
====== unextpath

A <<param-type-path,path>>.
See section <<path-arguments>>.

===== Parameter Flag

[#usage]
== Usage

This section describes how the <<descriptor_file,representation>>
of a _plugin_ should be interpreted by a container runtime
to execute an instance of the _program_ described by the _plugin_ given its 
<<executable,executable>>, a set of <<arguments,arguments>>,
and <<data-directories,data directories>>.

[#executable]
=== Executable

The _executable_ is a string which invokes the plugin's _program_.
It is resolved from the plugin's
<<execshell,`execshell`>>, <<selfpath,`selfpath`>>, and <<selfexec,`selfexec`>>,
which are joined by the template:

[source]
----
{execshell} {selfpath}{selfexec}
----

[#arguments]
=== Arguments

_Arguments_ are a sequence of strings which correspond to
<<plugin-parameters>> and user-specified values for those parameters.

[#path-arguments]
==== Path arguments

At runtime, the string following a flag denoting
<<param-type-path,path>> or <<param-type-unextpath,unextpath>> type arguments
are to be replaced by the string `/share/incoming`.

Data in _ChRIS_ object storage under the value given by a
<<param-type-path,path>> argument should be copied to a <<volumes,volume>>
mounted on `/share/incoming`.

// retrospection https://github.com/FNNDSC/python-pfconclient/tree/c36aafd17cceb126a303e1f55e0e1edab95f0db1#arguments-of-type-path-or-unextpath
// retrospection https://github.com/FNNDSC/pman/blob/898b8a19593b0f16e1415442d4bfbdeddb7dd38b/pman/resources.py#L115-L130

[#data-directories]
==== Data Directories

Let `data_directories` be a string with the values depending on the _plugin_'s
<<plugin-type,type>>:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Plugin Type |Data directories

|fs
|`/outgoing`

|ds
|`/incoming /outgoing`

|ts
|`/incoming /outgoing`
|===

[#invocation]
=== Invocation

The _plugin's_ _program_ is to be invoked by running a
_container_ of its <<dock_image,image>> with a command resolved by the string template:

[source]
----
{executable} {arguments} {data_directories}
----

[#volumes]
==== Volumes

<<data-directories,`data_directories`>> are mount points for volumes
where input files can be read from and output files can be written to.

The volume mounted to `/incoming` contains input files
and should be mounted *read-only*.

The volume mounted to `/outgoing` contains output files
and should be mounted *read-write*.

If the mountpoints do not exist within the container filesystem,
the container runtime is to create them.

[#flexibility]
==== Flexibility

While this spec standardizes the execution of ChRIS plugins, non-conformant
implementations may work equally well. This section describes a common
yet non-conformant pattern.

===== Single Share Directory

A single volume is mounted *read-write* to `/share`.
The volume contains subdirectories `./incoming` and `./outgoing`,
and `data_directories` are defined as `/share/incoming /share/outgoing`, etc.
This pattern is easy to design and implement.

This is how the `abstractmgr.py` or https://github.com/FNNDSC/pman[pman] version `~=3` was designed.

https://apptainer.org/[Apptainer] works a similar way by automatically mounting
`$HOME` and `$PWD` into the container filesystem on their respective host paths.

[#pluginmeta]
== Plugin Meta

_ChRIS_ plugin meta is an abstract association of a subset of
_ChRIS_ plugin attributes. These attributes are:

- <<name,name>>
- <<public_repo,URL>>
- title
- authors
- category
- documentation
- icon
- license

A _plugin meta_ defines a set of
<<definition,_ChRIS_ plugins>> that have the same _plugin <<name,name>>_.
